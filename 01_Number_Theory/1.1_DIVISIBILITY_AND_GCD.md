## Divisibility

In the set of integers, numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied but the result will always stay in the set. This is not true for division.

Let $a$ and $b$ be integers with $(b \ne 0)$. We say that b divides a, or that a is divisible by b, if there is an integer c such that:
$(a \eq bc).

Given any positive integer n and any non-negative interger a, if a is divided by n, we get an integer quotient q and an integer reminder(residue) r such that:
$(a \eq qn + r)$
